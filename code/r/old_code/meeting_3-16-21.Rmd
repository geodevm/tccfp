## Sex by species

- 1 male coyote was not collared (captured at same time/location as one that was collared).
- 1 female red fox not collared (mortality, killed in trap by coyote). 

```{r}
collars <- read.csv(here("data/latest_data.csv"))
biologicals <- read.csv(here("data/biologicals.csv"))
serum_vol <- read.csv(here("data/serum_volumes.csv"))
morts <- read.csv(here("data/mortalities.csv"))
sex <- table(biologicals$sex, biologicals$species)
barplot(sex, xlab = "species", legend = rownames(sex))
```

## Whether scat sample was collected.

```{r}
scat <- table(biologicals$scat, biologicals$species)
barplot(scat, xlab = "species", legend = rownames(scat))
```

## Whether fecal sample was collected.

```{r}
fecal <- table(biologicals$fecal, biologicals$species)
barplot(fecal, xlab = "species", legend = rownames(fecal))
```

## Whether hair sample was collected.

```{r}
hair <- table(biologicals$hair, biologicals$species)
barplot(hair, xlab = "species", legend = rownames(hair))
```
## Serum volumes

```{r}
serum <- table(serum_vol$serum_ml, serum_vol$species)
barplot(serum, xlab = "species", legend = rownames(serum), col = brewer.pal(14, name = "PRGn"))
```
## Mortalities and causes

```{r}
mortalities <- table(morts$cod, morts$species)
barplot(mortalities, xlab = "species", legend = rownames(mortalities), col = brewer.pal(5, name = "PRGn"))
```

- This is an extremely high incidence of coyote killings - which are typically regarded as a perceived risk in the literature that is rarely realized. With 3/7 of our red fox deaths (and an additional attack that did not result in mortality) on the project, it seams to be a significant mortality risk in this population.
- One of the 'free-ranging' foxes had mange as a co-morbidity, other was seemingly healthy besides injuries incurred in attacks.

## Map of all locations to date.

- 7 coyote collars dropped off or collected from mortality
- 6/7 of those collars have had the full datalog file retrieved from the collar (1 was too chewed up by coyote's mate, inquiring with Telonics about work-arounds)
- 6 fox collars retrieved from mortalities
- all of those datalogs retrieved
- 7 coyote collars currently deployed and contining to collect data
- 10 fox collars currently deployed and continuing to collect data

```{r}
options(width=165,digits.secs = 3)
opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12,fig.height=4.5, error=TRUE,cache = FALSE)
canid.dat <- as(collars, "data.frame")
canid.dat <- canid.dat %>% mutate(acquisition_time = ymd_hms(acquisition_time, tz = "UTC"))
leaflet(collars) %>% addTiles()%>%
  addCircles(canid.dat$gps_longitude, canid.dat$gps_latitude)
```

## Urbanization in the TCMA.

#### Urbanization index is arbitrary - population is given a weight 5 times percent impervious surface.

## Locations by animal ID number

```{r}
ggplot(canid.dat, 
       aes(gps_longitude, gps_latitude, color = species, 
           group = animal_id))+
  geom_point() + coord_equal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
